# Specifying metadata about an endpoint

```eval_rst
.. attention:: These docs are for Scribe for JS v1, which is no longer maintained. See `scribe.knuckles.wtf/nodejs <http://scribe.knuckles.wtf/nodejs>`_ for Scribe for JS v2.
```

## Endpoint title and description
To set an endpoint's title and description, just write in a docblock at the route declaration. The first paragraph will be used as the title, the rest as the description. Custom formatting (such as `<aside>` tags) is also supported (see the [Pastel docs](http://github.com/knuckleswtf/pastel-js)).

For instance, this:

```js
/**
 * Add a word to the list.
 *
 * This endpoint allows you to add a word to the list. It's a really useful endpoint,
 * and you should play around with it for a bit.
 * <aside class="notice">We mean it; you really should.ðŸ˜•</aside>
 */
app.post('words', (req, res) => {
    
})
```

becomes:

```eval_rst
.. Note:: There needs to be a blank line between the title and description.
```

```eval_rst
.. Tip:: For best results, all free text (title and description) should come before any annotations.
```

## Grouping endpoints
All endpoints are grouped for easy navigation.

To add an endpoints to a group, use `@group` in its docblock, followed by the group's title. You can also add a description using the `@groupDescription` tag.

```eval_rst
.. Tip:: You don't need to specify the :code:`@groupDescription` in every endpoint's docblock. Just use it in one and Scribe'll pick it uo.
```

```js
/**
 * Change a user's password.
 * 
 * @group Account management
 * @groupDescription Managing accounts
 */
app.post('changePassword', (req, res) => {
});
```

Grouping endpoints is optional. Any endpoints not in a group will be placed in a default group, "Endpoints" (or whatever is specified in your config file as `defaultGroup`).

## Indicating authentication status
If you have `auth.default` set to `false` in your config, your endpoints will be treated as open by default. You can use the `@authenticated` annotation on a method to indicate that the endpoint is authenticated.

Similarly, if you have `auth.default` set to `true` in your config, your endpoints will be treated as authenticated by default. You can use the `@unauthenticated` annotation on a method to indicate that the endpoint is unauthenticated. 

```eval_rst
.. Tip:: You can also specify `@authenticated` or `@unauthenticated` in a controller doc block instead to override the status for all the routes in that controller. 

```js
/**
 * Create a user
 * 
 * This endpoint lets you create a user.
 * @authenticated
 *
 */
app.post('/createUser', (req, res) => {
});
```

A "Requires authentication" badge will be added to that endpoint in the generated documentation.
